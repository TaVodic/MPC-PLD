2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell pwm_driver_i/s_dir_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) pwm_driver_i/s_dir_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[2] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[3] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[4] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[5] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[6] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[7] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch pwm_driver_i/s_dir_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin pwm_driver_i/s_dir_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
